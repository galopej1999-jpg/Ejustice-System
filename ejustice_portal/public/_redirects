# Netlify Redirects Configuration
# Proxy API and backend routes to Railway PHP backend
# This file ensures requests to /api, /public, /includes, etc. go to your Railway backend
# while static assets (JS, CSS, images) are served from Netlify CDN

# Redirect all backend routes to Railway backend
# Replace RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL with your actual Railway app URL (e.g., https://ejustice-portal-prod.railway.app)
/*  RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL/:splat  200

# If you have static assets in a specific folder, uncomment and adjust:
# /css/*    /css/:splat  200
# /js/*     /js/:splat   200
# /images/* /images/:splat 200
